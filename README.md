#Python Apk Installer
This is a simple python script to install APK Files in given directory to your android phone
###Requirements
* ADB

### How to use?
Put all your apk files in /home/[User]/Downloads/Apks. Make sure your apk files donot contain any special charactes. And run the script.

###Limitations:
* Currently this only works on linux.
* This program uses absolute path so you'll need to edit the script to change the filename or username
* Currently it is too buggy. I haven't tested it extensively.
  
### Todo List:
- [ ] Add Windows Support
- [ ] Add an interactive interface to choose the folder containing apks
- [ ] Test for bugs
- [ ] Remove the need for end user to touch the script at all
